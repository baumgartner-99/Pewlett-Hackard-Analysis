# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to create a database and pull a list of retiring employees to help management prepare for the future of the company. For this assignment, two lists were pulled: the number of retiring employees by title, and a list of employees eligible for a potential mentorship program. 

## Results

From this first table, you will see a count of retirees by most recent title. There are two major points we can conclude from this table:
  1. There are only two managers will be retiring. As this number is much smaller than the rest, perhaps this is an indicator that this company is only hiring younger managers.
  2. There are over 25,000 retiring employees who have the word "Senior" in their title. This may indicate that there will be many promotions in the future for those who are younger in the company.

The next table is much larger and does not fit into a single image. This is the list that holds the current employees elibigle for the Mentorship Program. From this list, we can conclude the following:
  1. There are a total of 1,550 employees eligible for this program.
  2. These employees have varying years of experience at this company.

## Summary
There are a large number of roles that will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins. Specifically, according to the first table, there will be 33,118 vacancies after all employees have been retired. With that said, given that there are just over 1,500 employees who are eligible for the mentorship program, there may not be enough employees to mentor the next generation if the company wants to maintain its current size.

Another query that could be useful for this analysis is to adjust the mentorship elibility table to include all retiring employees who have been at the company for 5 or more years. Further, we could look at the salaries of retiring employees to see if any funds in the budget could be reallocated after those employees have retired.
